**DISPLAY EMOJI-BASED FACIAL EXPRESSION || FACIAL EXPRESSION DECTEXTION**


There are many different ways to express and communicate our feelings. The two classified 
ways of communication are verbal and non - verbal. Facial expressions are a great way of 
communication Involving the exchange of wordless intimations. It has enticed much research 
attention in the field of computer vision and Artificial intelligence. Many kinds of research 
have been done for grouping these expressions. It is chiefly done to acquire the sentiments of 
humans. In this project, an API can be employed to fetch images from any camera-based 
application in real time. HAAR cascade classifier is employed to extract the image features 
from the images fetched earlier. Support Vector Machines (SVM) is used to classify those 
features into corresponding expressions. And these expressions are then converted to their 
equivalent emoji, after that these emoji, are get superimposed over the actual face expression 
as a mask. This project can be used to study the different facial expressions that a machine can 
understand and also it can be used as a filter used in social media apps like Facebook, 
Instagram, snapchat etc.
